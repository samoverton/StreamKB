StreamKB 1.3
============
StreamKB is an on-screen keyboard that highlights which keys are being pressed.

The purpose for this is to allow streamers to show their viewers which keys are being pressed.

Pressing the buttons in this application does not generate keystrokes.

Right click context menu brings up options for color, keyboard resizing, and to exit.

The StreamKB window can be dragged from any point inside the program window.

Color and position settings are saved in StreamKB.settings, which can be deleted to return to default.

StreamKB is released under the GNU GPLv3 Licence, see licence-gpl.txt for more info.

Note:
StreamKB requires Java – Global (low level) Keyboard Hook (Distributed under the Simplified BSD License)
The Keyboard library must be in the build path to compile
